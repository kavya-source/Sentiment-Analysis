I had no choice as it was pouring with rain and I’m also pregnant! I explained to the driver who was also appalled by the price!

He said you will get your money back in your OLA ACCOUNT.<br/><br/>The cab itself was a flop show the OLA APP gave false promises that your cab will be with luxury features I could hardly sit in there my luggage was on the backseat and it’s a CNG CAR SO NO POINT I CAN KEEP MY LUGGAGE IN THE DIGGI.<br/>OlA SHOLD NOT FORCE TRAVELLER TO HAVE SIT IN THE CNG CARS IF ITS OUTSTATION AND CHARGING STUPID FEES.<br/><br/>the meter at the beginning of the trip showed <br/>meter reading    :       214661km<br/>Trip end reading:       215048KM <br/>If you do math it’s :  387km<br/><br/>BUT OLA math said it’s 487KM they added 100km extra from somewhere no one knows.<br/>I was charged for extra time. First of all the driver ran out of CNG and made we wait 40 minutes each time every time he took me to different different CNG stations.<br/><br/><br/>It was the most pathetic experience I have ever had in traveling with OLA.<br/>Since the beginning the driver had no clue what he was doing.<br/>The cab stunk like tobacco as the driver was kept eating and the whole messed up. <br/>The car dint have AC and the driver kept the windows open till the whole trip. I asked him to turn it down but he dint turn the AC on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I just want to know why that happened.

Went back onto the app but the car was no longer there, I didn’t want to book again as I didn’t want to be charged for 2 bookings. I used my other phone which showed the price for an Ola was £3-£4 for the same journey. While in the process of booking the price suddenly jumped up to £7-£12!!! How disgusting! I had no choice as it was pouring with rain and I’m also pregnant! I explained to the driver who was also appalled by the price! I then checked again on my other phone to see that my original driver cancelled and the price had gone down back to £3-£4! The customer service is terrible as you can’t actually communicate with anyone... You get a generic computer response as to why you've been charged that price. The hygiene of the drivers is unprofessional, the cars are always filthy and a lot of them drive like they haven’t even had a driving test.\n",

Explained the situation further and told them he never got to my location and this is an absolute lie! I get cabs every day and I’m always wearing a mask. They were absolutely useless and claimed “the system does not allow” them to process a refund! Very very frustrating.

Avoid this company at all costs. I booked a journey but the driver cancelled the ride. I then booked a second driver, was collected and dropped off at my destination. I then realised that I had been charged for the cancelled journey. I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn\\u0027t take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience. How is this company even in business?

I do not recommend this app at all, the customer \\u0027care\\u0027 team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!\\n\\nthis saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road.  Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.\\n\\nI waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)\\nI messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place. \\nThe driver messaged back saying he can\\u0027t pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense. \\nInstead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for \\u0027violating covid-regulations\\u0027. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn\\u0027t take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!\\n\\nI phoned the \\u0027customer care\\u0027 line which was a complete waste of time. The \\u0027advisor\\u0027 refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was \\u0027breaking covid violations\\u0027. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the \\u0027advisor\\u0027 talked about how the \\u0027system won\\u0027t allow a refund\\u0027 which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!\\n\\nI then emailed this complaint to their \\u0027customer care\\u0027 team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their \\u0027evidence\\u0027 of their made up false accusation of me not \\u0027following covid regulations\\u0027 and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point. \\nPredictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint. \\n\\nI was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home.

Avoid this company at all costs. I booked a journey but the driver cancelled the ride. I then booked a second driver, was collected and dropped off at my destination. I then realised that I had been charged for the cancelled journey. I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn\\u0027t take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience. How is this company even in business?

I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn't take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience. How is this company even in business? Again avoid this company at all costs.\n",

      "                Ola have tried to take me for a fool. I do not recommend this app at all, the customer 'care' team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!<br/><br/>this saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road.  Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.<br/><br/>I waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)<br/>I messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place. <br/>The driver messaged back saying he can't pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense. <br/>Instead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for 'violating covid-regulations'. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn't take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!<br/><br/>I phoned the 'customer care' line which was a complete waste of time. The 'advisor' refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was 'breaking covid violations'. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the 'advisor' talked about how the 'system won't allow a refund' which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!<br/><br/>I then emailed this complaint to their 'customer care' team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their 'evidence' of their made up false accusation of me not 'following covid regulations' and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point. <br/>Predictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint. <br/><br/>I was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home. I can't take public transport due to the health risks and travel bans, and OLA has no sense of service or moral compass.\n",

I then booked a second driver, was collected and dropped off at my destination. I then realised that I had been charged for the cancelled journey. I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn't take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience.

I do not recommend this app at all, the customer 'care' team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!<br/><br/>this saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road.  Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.<br/><br/>I waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)<br/>I messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place. <br/>The driver messaged back saying he can't pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense. <br/>Instead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for 'violating covid-regulations'. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn't take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!<br/><br/>I phoned the 'customer care' line which was a complete waste of time. The 'advisor' refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was 'breaking covid violations'. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the 'advisor' talked about how the 'system won't allow a refund' which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!<br/><br/>I then emailed this complaint to their 'customer care' team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their 'evidence' of their made up false accusation of me not 'following covid regulations' and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point. <br/>Predictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint. <br/><br/>I was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home. I can't take public transport due to the health risks and travel bans, and OLA has no sense of service or moral compass.\n",

I suggested we return to the highway and he agreed but instead of doing so continued to drive away from the highway into the back streets, slowly zigzagging his way towards my house. at this point he was completely ignoring the gps.Once we got back to a major road approaching a traffic light the light changed to yellow, we were very close and could have comfortably made it though. instead he chose to brake abruptly sending my possessions onto the floor and prompting the car behind us to beep in frustration.After getting home my fair was sent to me and was 31% higher than quoted!

Delhi airport to Ajmer where my house is 387KM but the OLA magically increased it to 487KM, and charged me INR 11009 which is a lot because I travel from ajmer to Delhi airport IT CAN NEVER BE 487, so OLA APP is Deformed and they are making fool out of people.Then the driver had CNG ISSUES in his car he took me two different gas stations where he couldn’t find the CNG but we waited 40 minutes just at gas station(CNG). He said you will get your money back in your OLA ACCOUNT.The cab itself was a flop show the OLA APP gave false promises that your cab will be with luxury features I could hardly sit in there my luggage was on the backseat and it’s a CNG CAR SO NO POINT I CAN KEEP MY LUGGAGE IN THE DIGGI.OlA SHOLD NOT FORCE TRAVELLER TO HAVE SIT IN THE CNG CARS IF ITS OUTSTATION AND CHARGING STUPID FEES.the meter at the beginning of the trip showed meter reading    :       214661kmTrip end reading:       215048KM If you do math it’s :  387kmBUT OLA math said it’s 487KM they added 100km extra from somewhere no one knows.I was charged for extra time. First of all the driver ran out of CNG and made we wait 40 minutes each time every time he took me to different different CNG stations.It was the most pathetic experience I have ever had in traveling with OLA.Since the beginning the driver had no clue what he was doing.The cab stunk like tobacco as the driver was kept eating and the whole messed up. The car dint have AC and the driver kept the windows open till the whole trip. I asked him to turn it down but he dint turn the AC on.I just want to know why that happened. For sure this was my last and final trip with OLA ever and I will spread the word so no one should travel with OLA.I want to be called by OLA and solve this issue. Give me my money back.\n",

I booked a car for a 0.99 mile journey (3mins drive from where I was) at £3-£4 which confirmed my driver was 3mins away, waited 4-5mins still no car. Went back onto the app but the car was no longer there, I didn’t want to book again as I didn’t want to be charged for 2 bookings. I used my other phone which showed the price for an Ola was £3-£4 for the same journey. While in the process of booking the price suddenly jumped up to £7-£12!!! How disgusting! I had no choice as it was pouring with rain and I’m also pregnant! I explained to the driver who was also appalled by the price! I then checked again on my other phone to see that my original driver cancelled and the price had gone down back to £3-£4! The customer service is terrible as you can’t actually communicate with anyone... You get a generic computer response as to why you've been charged that price. The hygiene of the drivers is unprofessional, the cars are always filthy and a lot of them drive like they haven’t even had a driving test.\n",

Explained the situation further and told them he never got to my location and this is an absolute lie! I get cabs every day and I’m always wearing a mask. They were absolutely useless and claimed “the system does not allow” them to process a refund! Very very frustrating. Spoke to about 5 different people including managers and they all repeated the same thing like robots.

I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn't take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor.

I do not recommend this app at all, the customer 'care' team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!this saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road.  Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.I waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)I messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place. The driver messaged back saying he can't pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense. Instead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for 'violating covid-regulations'. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn't take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!I phoned the 'customer care' line which was a complete waste of time. The 'advisor' refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was 'breaking covid violations'. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the 'advisor' talked about how the 'system won't allow a refund' which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!I then emailed this complaint to their 'customer care' team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their 'evidence' of their made up false accusation of me not 'following covid regulations' and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point. Predictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint. I was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home. I can't take public transport due to the health risks and travel bans, and OLA has no sense of service or moral compass.\n",

Once the driver(Nelakanti Srikanth) dropped me off he asked me to pay the whole amount in cash not just the balance and he will cancel my earlier online payment and i will get the money back in 2 days as he needs money to refuel the petrol and go back to Hyd. I felt his point made sense and paid 3500Rs in cash to him its been 3 weeks and i havent received my money yet and whenever i create a ticket they say they spoke to the driver and he told he didnt take any additional cash. I am robbed off 2500 rupees and everyone is lying in here. Its so pathetic that the driver(nelakanti Srikanth) mentioned that he didnt take any extra money when he actually did.

      "                So... I actually worked for OlaCabs in the UK in the past - and what a shocking company to work for... Let's get some technical nitty-gritty stuff out of the way first:1) logging in to the olacabs website as a driver, and I'm REQUIRED to tick the box aggreeing to my number or data being used, so that I can be sent further materials or promotions or news in the future2) there's no way to use the Ola Driver / Ola Partner app with Developer Mode enabled on your device. I had hoped that this was going to be addressed, but 18 months later and it's still forced on people to disabled developer mode. 3) once you login online, there's no way to get a printout of all your completed fares, or a yearly summary for tax purposes.Okay - so now down to dealing with the company itself... If you've ever got a query or concerned about anything, contacting OlaCabs is pretty much useless. Their support have poor language skills, so a lot of the time don't even understand what's being asked of them. Both as a user and driver, I've had to contact OlaCabs Support several times just to get one singular issue resolved.When I first started working for them, they were renting office space, and trying to find which office was a nightmare, because there was nobody around from OlaCabs at the office - they were all in some waiting area with no signage to communicate that. Then I had an issue receiving my sign-up bonus, being told that the \"offer had expired\" essentially even though it couldn't have, as the dates depicted on their own advertisement cards to get more drivers had me doing everything correct, to the correct timescale. When things are working properly in the driver app, it seems to be fine and apart from what I can only deem as \"random cancellations\" (because I've seen the same customer at the same location attempting to request a taxi later on) I've not had many issues from that sort of perspective. But the DRIVER app needs an overhaul and development from a team that actually want to be part of this universal \"competition\" for being a company that provides taxi services to the public. Their USER app - for requesting rides - seems to be okay for the most part as it's been updated to be similar in end user experience to what Uber offer, but the Uber platform and everything about it is just so much better. My honest opinion? Pay a slightly higher price that features a bit more safety, and get an Uber. . . . As a final note, I would like to say that I've seen people give low ratings because \"the driver took the long way round\". There isn't an excuse for doing that deliberately, but most of the time drivers are following their GPS or taking longer routes that avoid congestion and traffic jams. Of course, people seem to have forgotten how to communicate, because passengers can always tell or show the driver(s) a better route. I guess the art of communication is lost these days. A lot of the time, people just want to get to where they're going - they don't want it to take excessive amounts of time or be extortionate, financially - but to make the complaint \"they went the long way\" when you don't say anything yourself is almost ironic.\n",

      "                I am completely dissatisfied with the Ola service I have received. Your reviews on Google are a clear reflection of how you value customers as a series of 1 star reviews seem to be the normal rating for your services.I have a number of issues.I spoke to UJAN on the phone to complain about the unjustifiable jump in price CHARGED in comparison to the quote. Original charge quoted £6-9 which is what I booked at...and charged the day before at only £5 for the exact same journey...Then I get a message on completion of the journey of £18!That is a 3x price hike with no reasonable justification.Ujans reasoning on the phone was that there was not enough taxi cabs in the area. I saw at least 6 taxi cabs within a 200 metre radius and I booked it at a destination on a main road, where I even walked closer to the meeting point to make the pickup easier and drive literally on a straight road for no more than ten minutes. High demand of taxis cannot be a reason To charge 3x the price when there was multiple cars sitting and waiting on the roads for passengers, and especially as I know my area and where the taxi drivers sit and wait around, there was no inconvenience to any driver and no shortage of cars. A few weeks previous I had a series of issues with your driver's cancelling rides unannounced whilst in Birmingham trying to get to a work meeting. I was LATE to that meeting by over 30 minutes solely due to cancelled rides because of your driver's and lack of communication. Thankfully that was resolved and I was refunded a cancellation charge that your driver's seem to have a habit of doing outside of London, with no consequence. But the inconvenience that this app has given me each time I have decide to give it a chance is unacceptable.I have never been charged outside of the threshold with Uber or Kapten. Only Ola.I have also never had to deal with such consistent poor service in regards to misrepresentation of service.It is almost disrespectful that Ola seems to have a complete disregard to clients needs and concerns. Ujan was not helpful at all and to be honest had a tone that no client would be satisfied with having been charged a disproportionate amount.I will be complaining further to parties who can make sure your directors are aware of the misrepresentation and negligence of your staff and scam worthy technology. If this means going to press and community leaders who will investigate your operations further, then so be it. I have never used Uber and been charged an amount they make up out of the top of their head. So I refuse to use a new app like Ola and have you steal money from more clients and will make sure I share the message to others to avoid this all at all costs. I would never pay £18 for a journey I could take for £1.50 on a bus, £2.90 on a train or £5-6 using any taxi service. So for your company to deem it acceptable to not notify an individual and charge them an inflated price is quite frankly unethical and unprofessional. I demand a refund of £13 for the journey. I am extremely dissatisfied.\n",

There is no standards followed by this company, thry just started this company as copy business of Uber but they are really unprofessionals. No comparison between world class company like Uber and a highly unprofessional Ola. I had taken a ola cab from Delhi to jaipur. Initially it showed me 2700 fare and driver knew i came from abroad. He stopped the cab on the way 4 times for almost 2 hrs adding all together. He took 500 rupees for gas too. When i reached jaipur he requested 950 rupees for toll plaza so overall he took 5200 rupees despite having showing 2900 bill initially. Being a NRI i didn't know much about long rides using ola but definitely it was a very poor experience.i complained about it to ola just and email because there is no phone number showing on the website. Ola replied back after 4 days sating thry can't do anything and closed the ticket immediately with notifying me. Highly unprofessional and never replied back to my queries again. Safety concerns were also there but ola doesn't reply at all. Please boycott ola and avoid them. I am going to post this experience everywhere including UK ola services too because i have no choice left because of their lack of response. I will take legal action as well against them.\n",

      "                OLA AND UBER CABS IN BENGALURUIt appears to me that the most dangerous Ola and Uber Cab service is in Bengaluru, as I always thought Delhi was bad, but Bengaluru beats it heads on.The drivers appear to have learnt to manipulate so many tricks to fleece the customers, that I have come to the conclusion it may not only be better, but also safer at times to pay double and book the hotel taxi if at all possible.On a recent 5 days visit to Bengaluru, on at least 6 different occasions, the drivers made numerous attempts to cheat me, firstly from the Airport to the Hotel, when I gave the OTP to commence the journey, within seconds of obtaining a message that the trip has commenced, the driver tells me that there is no trip and wanted  to see my phone, basically to see what the fare was showing. I remained very firm, and informed my wife that in case the situation worsened, and he took us out of the way, to immediately call the police, because there is absolutely no facility on their apps to reach Customer Service or Police in an emergency. The driver then gathered that I was going to have none of his nonsense, and I turned on the navigation on my mobile phone and ensured he took us to the hotel in the shortest route possible.  This actually happened with at least two drivers, but the worst ones were that once you book the cab, the driver calls to ascertain what the final destination is, which they are not supposed to, and immediately cancels the trip thereby incurring the passenger a cancellation charge.The worst one was on having booked in advance for an airport drop off, the first driver asked my destination and as I refused to give it, cancelled the booking, and within seconds another driver accepted the booking. When I informed him that the drop was to the airport, he tells me that he is not going, when I said I will complain about him, he became abusive and threatened me, saying he knew where I was and would come and sort me out. As I was getting late for the airport, I fortunately managed to book the Hotel Taxi and reached the airport just in time.The government has brought in new regulations in respect to all the aggregator cab services, which are more in favour of the drivers. I am in favour of that, but it is absolutely imperative that new legislation is made in regards to the safety of passengers and unwarranted cancellations, because despite writing to the CEO of OLA, he neither had the courtesy to acknowledge nor respond to my mail, and it is about time they were held responsible for all the illegal actions of the drivers or ensure that these crooked drivers do not ply cabs on their platforms immediately after they resort to threats or regular cancellations of the cab journeys.\n",

      "                Hi Ola,            It's a very bad experience riding in ola. Auto driver came and said my mobile is switched off. Hence, what ever amount is showing the total amount in your ola application please pay that amount. In my application Rs.251 was showing and I paid Rs.251. after driver went away ola application showing  your total fare is 186rs. I paid rs.65 rupees. Hence, I have got cheated by ola auto driver. I think this is the trick which is using by ola drivers to make customer fool by telling mobile is switched and taking away extra cash. Even I told ola auto driver that shall I pay online wallet payment when I was I auto on the way but driver refused and said no no don't do online or wallet payment. Only cash I need he said. Ola drivers are very greedy they only operates and come when the ride is by cash only. This is not not the concern or 65rs. It's about trust. I have been cheated from ola hence, I will not use or use less ola. I might switch to Uber or can prefer local auto or rides but this type of cheating is not acceptable. I can knock the consumer court and complain in consumer court for this issue.Thank youName : Shyam RanjanPhone : 7004835713\n",

I booked one from Shepherd’s Bush to Euston tower. I had no problems as it reached me within a few minutes. But was another story going back to Shepherd’s Bush. Booked one and it said seven minutes then said 27 minutes as it was no dropping off another customer. I sent the driver a message to say where I’d be and with two very heavy suitcases. He drives past me and my ride is cancelled. Apparently he couldn’t stop the car! Then I ring the ‘customer service’ line and explain but to no avail. I explained that it was imperative that I got home quickly as I had to collect my son from school. Security staff tried to contact local cabs and tried to flag down a black cab but to no avail. Then I reluctantly had to order another Ola cab. Again it gave a time then kept chopping and changing because he picked someone else on the way. Fortunately there was a black cab nearby charging and I was able to get a cab back. Honestly I will never recommend this company to anyone especially single women on their own and in fact anyone who hasn’t hours to waste and values their safety. They have zero duty care for customers. Profit before customer care! Avoid Ola at all costs. Stick to black cabs 🙏🏽\n",

So at the end I have paid him by cash. So two times in online payment my money got deducted.After reaching my home I have raised the complaint to phone pay and Ola to return back my two times failed transaction money, so from phone pe I got reply that Ola is saying that they provide service for both the transaction so transaction is valid which is totally a lie from Ola side and after providing all the transaction related proof to Ola, They took more than one month to decide that my complaint is valid and they have to refund me money of online transactions because I did not use any service regarding that transactions.Now when they are agree that I have made the payment thrice that day, they are refunding my money back to my Ola account only so I can used in future booking from Ola app, which is not acceptable they should refund my money back to my bank account from where I made transaction. In response of my query they are saying that they cannot refund back my money in my bank account because it is against their policy.

      "                This is the first time I am using Ola that too because of COVID situation and it has been a very bad experience. I think where OLA should have been a little more sensitive during COVID situation they are in fact by taking long routes and over charging the customers for the same.Being a doctor my each minute is precious (and not only for me it is for each customer) but every time the ola people take a longer route to mint more money and at the same time I always reach my clinic late despite boarding the Ola Auto on time. I have been travelling since 6 Jul 2020 and mostly i get a fare of around 162/- sometimes it is 174 or 182/- and little bit difference in amount is understandable but on many rides they calculate the fare around 240 and that much difference is not acceptable. When their driver cancels the ride then also they charge it from the customer, even after complaining they don't refund the amount. They deliberately take long routes to overcharge the customers and now last time when i refused to pay 240 and paid my regular fare so now they have been asking me to pay 81 rs to resume the services. Instead of unethically extracting money from customers OLA should make sure that their services are up to the mark. So my advise to OLA1. Value your passenger/customer's time2. Value their money3. Make sure you take correct routes so that your customers are not overcharged and also they reach their destination on time.4. Don't unnecessarily harass your customers and your drivers (i have seen your drivers too frustrated with your management)5. Whereas you claim that you are following all precautionary guidelines for COVID but I have seen only 20% of your OLA autos having a protective sheet between the driver and passenger, I have not seen any of your OLA driver sanitizing the seats, many drivers have to be repeatedly reminded of wearing their mask.Being a doctor I had thought by using your services it would be convenient for me to reach my clinic comfortably and on time. But I was highly disappointed. So stop harassing your customers and if you continue to send me messages to pay for the overcharged ride then I will have to move to the consumer court since i have screen shots of all the rides that I have taken with you so far. Anyhow I am sure of one thing I will never recommend OLA to anyone.Dr. Jaishree\n",

I was shell shocked and told her that I have all of the details along with the transaction receipt to which she said ok I've raised a complaint on behalf of you and the team will get in touch via mail (which never happened). I waited for a couple of days and wrote a mail to ola support for which I got the same revert that the team is working on the issue and get quick help by clicking \"support section\" in the ola app. Today, the 9th of July, I wrote them back and there's nothing from them again. I guess I've made my point and by the look of other user's experience, we all know what decision to be taken.\n",

When I got home I realised I got charged for the cab driver who cancelled on me I called ola the advisor I spoke to named spencer said there is nothing he can do then put meOn hold and cut the line I then called back again and said this is unfare he himself said to me he can see the driver cancelled after getting to the location I said to him so the driver did this yet I am charged and your saying there nothing you can do about this. He said he can’t refund my money and then later putting me on hold again then goes the driver saying he couldn’t find you and that’s why he cancelled I was so furious at this point it’s like the guy on the phone seemed so unbothered and having a laugh about this. He goes he sent a voucher code to only use on the app for the amount I then said I do not want this my money was taken unfarelyI want my money refunded he goes they cannot and can use this on my next journey I then explained I don’t want to use this app again.\n",

I had a midwife appointment at the UCLH in the early morning and tried to get a taxi from Ola three times. The first driver accepted my booking request immediately. After 6 minutes he called me and said \"You're going to Euston where has £15 congestion fee. Sorry, but I can't go there. You have to cancel it.\" I didn't want to be late; therefore, I listened to him and made another booking. The second driver didn't even arrive at the destination point and replied to neither my call nor my massages, for this Ola applied £6 cancellation fee to my account. After 15 minutes, the third driver came and picked me up at a few steps beyond my first departure location. I called Ola to explain what happened and get the cancellation fee. Unfortunately, they didn't refund due to changing my first departure point a few steps and didn't understand it was the second driver's fault. The only thing they need to do is checking two locations on the map.  At the end of the day, I was 45 minutes late for my appointment:(\n",

The primary route was ignored and the driver went in the wrong direction. The route then changed to go directly towards my home. The driver then started heading again in the wrong direction.Ola again made the decision that the fare was in parameters. It seems that they are encouraging drivers to take excessive routes to get more money out of customers.This is not good business ethics and is ripping people off. The worst thing about it is the drivers are also exploiting women alone, which can be a bit worrying. I called my partner whilst she was in the car and told her to ask the guy why he was travelling in the opposite direction. If I didn’t do that I dread to think what could have happened, the plastic all over the seats was something that also worried my partner.

I have contacted Ola back then complaining about my inability to use the voucher even though whenever I try to add it again to my account the app says that the voucher has already been added and Ola stopped replying after 2 emails. After that, I started receiving emails from Ola saying that my $10 discount was available and all I had to do was to book a ride. Well, I've booked a ride today and guess what? My $10 was not applied. I would like a refund for my ride and also my $10 voucher applied to my account.\n",

I am stuck at ola registration portal just only 1 document is not updating on the system its happening since a month every time I uploaded the document system doesn't recognise it keeps bringing up old documents, customer services at the front end they have limited access to the system so they can't override the situation, when I ask who will do that in reply there was a silence means they don't know. You can't create account until your registration process doesn't get completed...WHY??? All the system in entire world they first starts from creation of an account and then people starts to put their details so when an issue comes up it can be picked and rectified. So I did send an email as well with attached documents in case if they are not able to pick up on their SUPER DUPER OLA system which have Aladin Ginie hidden inside who is not able to pick up the documents and can't update the system how funny is that...they can't override their own created system.....what a lame excuse....wow...and by the way none of their manager or supervisor available to talk its part of their corporate culture.....and we all know where this customer service department exist....which is not in UK...now they are advising me to go in their branch so they can upload the documents...I said fault is in your system not from my side so you better need to rectify it from your end rather than you want me to run around here and there I have uploaded and attached in email as well.....what else you want me to do?.....I think this year award should goes to OLA.....for the best performance and company of the year...forget about Uber, Bolt or Kapten….just only OLA cause their system is absolutely fool proof (in their opinion)...come on guys stop creating these stupid hypes......and by the way your packages are just for the short term as soon as the offer will go out of the window you will see the difference in the numbers of drivers....your guys are keep calling to sell these packages where the weekly price will go up for more than 300 pounds a week with no guarantee of minimum earning come on wake up or have some Red Bull.....have your maths right before you approach drivers over phone to sell these packages....you guys needs at least 2 years where you will have a decent customer base and you can work at the level of BOLT or Uber.....it is quite big to ask in the beginning......I was simply trying to get registered on OLA as a back up app not as a first app....my prime app will always be Uber then BOLT or Kapten….then may be some where OLA....lolzzz.

Hence, what ever amount is showing the total amount in your ola application please pay that amount. In my application Rs.251 was showing and I paid Rs.251. after driver went away ola application showing  your total fare is 186rs. I paid rs.65 rupees. Hence, I have got cheated by ola auto driver. I think this is the trick which is using by ola drivers to make customer fool by telling mobile is switched and taking away extra cash. Even I told ola auto driver that shall I pay online wallet payment when I was I auto on the way but driver refused and said no no don't do online or wallet payment. Only cash I need he said. Ola drivers are very greedy they only operates and come when the ride is by cash only. This is not not the concern or 65rs. It's about trust. I have been cheated from ola hence, I will not use or use less ola. I might switch to Uber or can prefer local auto or rides but this type of cheating is not acceptable. I can knock the consumer court and complain in consumer court for this issue.Thank youName : Shyam RanjanPhone : 7004835713\n",

I booked one from Shepherd’s Bush to Euston tower. I had no problems as it reached me within a few minutes. But was another story going back to Shepherd’s Bush. Booked one and it said seven minutes then said 27 minutes as it was no dropping off another customer. I sent the driver a message to say where I’d be and with two very heavy suitcases. He drives past me and my ride is cancelled. Apparently he couldn’t stop the car! Then I ring the ‘customer service’ line and explain but to no avail. I explained that it was imperative that I got home quickly as I had to collect my son from school. Security staff tried to contact local cabs and tried to flag down a black cab but to no avail. Then I reluctantly had to order another Ola cab. Again it gave a time then kept chopping and changing because he picked someone else on the way. Fortunately there was a black cab nearby charging and I was able to get a cab back. Honestly I will never recommend this company to anyone especially single women on their own and in fact anyone who hasn’t hours to waste and values their safety. They have zero duty care for customers. Profit before customer care! Avoid Ola at all costs. Stick to black cabs 🙏🏽\n",

In response of my query they are saying that they cannot refund back my money in my bank account because it is against their policy.

      "                This is the first time I am using Ola that too because of COVID situation and it has been a very bad experience. I think where OLA should have been a little more sensitive during COVID situation they are in fact by taking long routes and over charging the customers for the same.Being a doctor my each minute is precious (and not only for me it is for each customer) but every time the ola people take a longer route to mint more money and at the same time I always reach my clinic late despite boarding the Ola Auto on time. I have been travelling since 6 Jul 2020 and mostly i get a fare of around 162/- sometimes it is 174 or 182/- and little bit difference in amount is understandable but on many rides they calculate the fare around 240 and that much difference is not acceptable. When their driver cancels the ride then also they charge it from the customer, even after complaining they don't refund the amount. They deliberately take long routes to overcharge the customers and now last time when i refused to pay 240 and paid my regular fare so now they have been asking me to pay 81 rs to resume the services. Instead of unethically extracting money from customers OLA should make sure that their services are up to the mark. So my advise to OLA1. Value your passenger/customer's time2. Value their money3. Make sure you take correct routes so that your customers are not overcharged and also they reach their destination on time.4. Don't unnecessarily harass your customers and your drivers (i have seen your drivers too frustrated with your management)5. Whereas you claim that you are following all precautionary guidelines for COVID but I have seen only 20% of your OLA autos having a protective sheet between the driver and passenger, I have not seen any of your OLA driver sanitizing the seats, many drivers have to be repeatedly reminded of wearing their mask.Being a doctor I had thought by using your services it would be convenient for me to reach my clinic comfortably and on time. But I was highly disappointed. So stop harassing your customers and if you continue to send me messages to pay for the overcharged ride then I will have to move to the consumer court since i have screen shots of all the rides that I have taken with you so far. Anyhow I am sure of one thing I will never recommend OLA to anyone.Dr. Jaishree\n",

I tried booking another ride after a couple of days and the app asked me to pay outstanding amount of Rs 581 to book a new ride, which for obvious reasons I didn't pay. Since then I've been receiving continuous messages on my phone to pay the due. I tried reaching ola support for consecutively 2 days from the app which felt like a lifetime of struggle (I'm sure most of us will agree to it) and I got connected to an executive. I told her all that had happened, then I got to know that the driver had raised a complaint of not being paid. I was shell shocked and told her that I have all of the details along with the transaction receipt to which she said ok I've raised a complaint on behalf of you and the team will get in touch via mail (which never happened). I waited for a couple of days and wrote a mail to ola support for which I got the same revert that the team is working on the issue and get quick help by clicking \"support section\" in the ola app. Today, the 9th of July, I wrote them back and there's nothing from them again.

I had a midwife appointment at the UCLH in the early morning and tried to get a taxi from Ola three times. The first driver accepted my booking request immediately. After 6 minutes he called me and said \"You're going to Euston where has £15 congestion fee. Sorry, but I can't go there. You have to cancel it.\" I didn't want to be late; therefore, I listened to him and made another booking. The second driver didn't even arrive at the destination point and replied to neither my call nor my massages, for this Ola applied £6 cancellation fee to my account. After 15 minutes, the third driver came and picked me up at a few steps beyond my first departure location. I called Ola to explain what happened and get the cancellation fee. Unfortunately, they didn't refund due to changing my first departure point a few steps and didn't understand it was the second driver's fault. The only thing they need to do is checking two locations on the map.  At the end of the day, I was 45 minutes late for my appointment:(\n",

The worst thing about it is the drivers are also exploiting women alone, which can be a bit worrying.

      "                I'm a driver in London. I referred another driver. I called them when I didn't receive referral payment. Adviser kept me on hold for few minutes to find out the reason. When I put call on mute, immediately, he dropped the call. I called back, explained again to another adviser. I was told, in 2 working days, £10 will be credited.After 3 days, I called them to find out. Adviser read a note of previous adviser and said, previous adviser made a note that \"i had a bad experience with rider and ride was unsafe\". But I had not reported anything like that but false note was created on my profile by previous adviser. I didn't mind losing £10 but now I'm scared of Ola's fraud.When company was launched in London, My friend selected Ola ultimate plan. He called Ola customer service for confirmation and he was confirmed on the phone. After a week when he didn't receive money as per plan. He called them and they said, he was not one of the first 1500 driver. So, he was put on another plan. When he asked to check the recorded phone calls, he was told that there was no phone call made or receive on that day and time.We get notifications for promotional offers in the morning. When they see more drivers are rushing for that offers, immediately they change the promotion. I feel, I am cheated by Ola.Finally uninstall the app.I don't know how they got licence from TFL.i'm scared (on youtub  / watch?v=7rmvhwwiQAY)\n",

After that, I started receiving emails from Ola saying that my $10 discount was available and all I had to do was to book a ride. Well, I've booked a ride today and guess what?

It’s actually relentless to the point where I don’t want to watch YouTube anymore. Their adverts suck, acting like they invented the taxi service, promoting ideas to problems that other companies solved a long time ago and in a much better way. It’s a joke and it needs to stop.

When I finished my ride they took the money from my account and again they charge me 2nd time for security purposes...why. What kind of security???? It’s without any service and without any of my authorisation. 3 time I talk with customer care they have to clean answer and one guy told me it’s deposit in your account within 24 hours but 24 hours later again 1 girl call me she told me it’s took some days.

None the less, the cab took more than 6 hours to reach.More over apart from this 2500, I had to pay different tolls, Taxes from my pocket which costed around 1000 bucks. Fare also showed more than 2500. I could have booked a Flight. Ola is not at all advisable from my side to travel on long routes. Plus, I would always prefer taking Bla Bla, Flight or train from next time onwards. Travelling in Ola is wastage of money which I felt it today.\n",

      "                What a frustrating process to get register as a driver. I am stuck at ola registration portal just only 1 document is not updating on the system its happening since a month every time I uploaded the document system doesn't recognise it keeps bringing up old documents, customer services at the front end they have limited access to the system so they can't override the situation, when I ask who will do that in reply there was a silence means they don't know. You can't create account until your registration process doesn't get completed...WHY??? All the system in entire world they first starts from creation of an account and then people starts to put their details so when an issue comes up it can be picked and rectified. So I did send an email as well with attached documents in case if they are not able to pick up on their SUPER DUPER OLA system which have Aladin Ginie hidden inside who is not able to pick up the documents and can't update the system how funny is that...they can't override their own created system.....what a lame excuse....wow...and by the way none of their manager or supervisor available to talk its part of their corporate culture.....and we all know where this customer service department exist....which is not in UK...now they are advising me to go in their branch so they can upload the documents...I said fault is in your system not from my side so you better need to rectify it from your end rather than you want me to run around here and there I have uploaded and attached in email as well.....what else you want me to do?.....I think this year award should goes to OLA.....for the best performance and company of the year...forget about Uber, Bolt or Kapten….just only OLA cause their system is absolutely fool proof (in their opinion)...come on guys stop creating these stupid hypes......and by the way your packages are just for the short term as soon as the offer will go out of the window you will see the difference in the numbers of drivers....your guys are keep calling to sell these packages where the weekly price will go up for more than 300 pounds a week with no guarantee of minimum earning come on wake up or have some Red Bull.....have your maths right before you approach drivers over phone to sell these packages....you guys needs at least 2 years where you will have a decent customer base and you can work at the level of BOLT or Uber.....it is quite big to ask in the beginning......I was simply trying to get registered on OLA as a back up app not as a first app....my prime app will always be Uber then BOLT or Kapten….then may be some where OLA....lolzzz.
